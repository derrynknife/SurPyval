Saving and Loading Models
=========================

A fitted model can be saved and restored later, or in another process,
without refitting. Almost every fitted SurPyval model can be serialised
to a plain dictionary with ``to_dict()`` and written to JSON with
``to_json(path)``. The dictionaries hold only plain Python types, so they
can also go straight into a document store (the round trip through
BSON/MongoDB is tested). What a restored model keeps, and what needs the
original data, is described in :doc:`Conventions`.

Restoring takes one call whichever class wrote the file: the
package-level readers dispatch on the serialised dictionary itself.

.. code:: python

    import surpyval

    model = surpyval.Weibull.fit(x)
    model.to_json("weibull.json")

    restored = surpyval.from_json("weibull.json")  # any model's file
    restored = surpyval.from_dict(model_dict)      # any model's dict

The class-level readers on the fitted-model classes
(``Parametric.from_dict``, ``SemiParametricRegressionModel.from_dict``,
... and the matching ``from_json``) remain available when the model class
is known up front; each rejects a dictionary written by a different class
with a ``ValueError``. The readers belong to the *model* classes, not to
the fitters: ``Weibull.from_dict`` and ``CoxPH.from_dict`` do not exist.

Two exceptions: ``CompetingRisksProportionalHazards`` cannot be
serialised (fit and save a ``FineGray`` or ``CoxPH`` model per cause
instead if you need to store the fit), and
``DestructiveDegradationModel`` has ``to_dict`` / ``from_dict`` but no
``to_json`` / ``from_json`` -- write its dictionary with ``json.dump``
and read it back with ``surpyval.from_dict``.
